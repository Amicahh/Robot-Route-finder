# Robot Route Finder

## Overview
The **Robot Route Finder** is a web application that utilizes the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the least expensive route for a robot navigating through a grid of stations. The robot can move between stations via different paths, each with an associated energy cost. This project aims to provide an efficient way to calculate the minimum energy required for the robot to travel from a starting station to an ending station with a specified maximum number of stops.

## Features
- Calculate the minimum energy cost for the robot to reach the destination.
- Display the path taken to achieve the least expensive route.
- User-friendly interface for inputting station details and viewing results.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Flask)
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript (AJAX for asynchronous requests)
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
